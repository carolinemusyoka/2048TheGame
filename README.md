 ## Gameplay
#### Tile Movement
Swiping up, down, left, or right moves tiles in the direction swiped.
        Tiles with the same number will merge. All other tiles will move across any open space on
        the board. A new tile will be added to the board with each swipe. New tiles will be numbered
        2 or 4.
        
#### Winning
Reach the 2048 tile to win the game. The challenge continues as you
        reach even higher number tiles. The game ends when the board fills up and you can\'t make
        any more moves. The game will be paused and saved whenever you leave the board or exit the
        app.
#### Statistics
See your detailed game stats by tapping Statistics on the home screen
        or on either score button above the game board.
#### Great Features
On the home screen you can toggle the Sounds, Undo, and Swipe Anywhere
        features on/off with a tap. Swipe Anywhere enabled players to swipe anywhere on the screen
        (not just on the board).
